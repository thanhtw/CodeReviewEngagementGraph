Subject: Invitation to Evaluate Peer Review Visualization System

Dear Professor,

I am Hoang-Thanh Duong, a Ph.D. candidate at Feng Chia University under Prof. Hsi-Min Chen's supervision. I am developing a "Review Graph Visualization" system to help instructors monitor student peer review engagement and comment quality in programming courses.

I would like to invite you to test the system and share your feedback through a brief questionnaire.


SYSTEM FEATURES
---------------
- Automated CSV data processing and organization by assignment
- ML-based review quality classification (Relevance, Concreteness, Constructiveness)
- Interactive network graph showing reviewer-author relationships
- Quality analysis charts and per-assignment statistics
- Score-review correlation analysis


WHAT YOU CAN DISCOVER
---------------------
Using this system, instructors can:
- Identify students who provide low-quality or empty reviews
- Track review engagement patterns across assignments
- Compare review quality metrics (relevance, concreteness, constructiveness)
- Discover correlations between student grades and review behaviors
- Spot students who need guidance in giving constructive feedback
- Monitor class-wide peer review participation at a glance


HOW TO TEST THE SYSTEM
----------------------

Step 1: Register & Login
- URL: http://140.134.25.70:8002/register
- Create your own account (username, password, display name)
- Or login at: http://140.134.25.70:8002/login

Step 2: Upload & Process Data
- Click "Upload CSV" to upload the sample data file (attached)
- Set homework range (e.g., HW1 to HW7)
- Click "Run Pipeline" to process the data

Step 3: Explore Visualizations

[GRAPH VIEW] http://140.134.25.70:8002/graph

The Graph View displays an interactive network diagram where:
- Nodes represent students (reviewers and authors)
- Edges show review relationships between students
- Charts show distribution of Relevance, Concreteness, and Constructiveness

Visual Elements Guide:

* Node Size: Larger nodes = higher average review scores received
  (Students receiving better feedback appear bigger)

* Node Color (Light to Dark):
  - Light color = shorter feedback comments
  - Dark color = longer, more detailed feedback
  (Darker nodes indicate students who write more comprehensive reviews)

* Edge Style:
  - Solid line = review contains feedback content
  - Dashed line = empty or missing review comment
  (Dashed edges help identify students who skip writing reviews)

* Quality Indicator Colors:
  - Yellow = Relevance (Is feedback related to the submission?)
  - Green = Concreteness (Is feedback specific and detailed?)
  - Purple = Constructiveness (Does feedback offer suggestions?)
  - Gray = No quality detected / Empty review

Teaching Benefits:
- Quickly identify isolated students with low engagement
- Spot patterns of ineffective reviewing behavior (dashed edges)
- See at a glance who writes detailed reviews (dark nodes)
- Click on any student to see their detailed review history


[SCORE ANALYSIS] http://140.134.25.70:8002/correlation

The Score Analysis page examines relationships between:
- Student homework/exam scores and their review activity
- Number of reviews given vs. academic performance
- Review quality metrics vs. learning outcomes

Teaching Benefits:
- Discover if high-performing students give better reviews
- Identify students who submit work but skip peer review
- Use data to encourage meaningful peer feedback
- Support grading decisions with objective review metrics


QUESTIONNAIRE (10-15 minutes)
